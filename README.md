I'm a freak that can't deal with linux unless it looks the way I want, so finally thought of sitting down and working on what I want.
Wallpaper is between the files by the way.

What it's consisted out of is :
 - [OSX Arc Shadow](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/osx-arc-shadow/)
 - [OSX Arc White](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/osx-arc-white/)
 - [Tint2 Panel](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/tint2)
 - [Papirus Icon](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/papirus/)

However, the `osx-arc-shadow` is not left the way it is, but it's been tweaked.
Download the zip, and after extracting it, replace the `.xpm`s with the `.png`s in `/usr/share/themes/OSX-Arc-Shadow/xfwm4/`.

Then close the xfce panel session and add tint2 to the startup applications.
After importing the tint2 theme, you should be good to go!

### Installation

All you have to do is get the `osx-arc-shadow` and `osx-arc-white` from `AUR`.
After that install `tint2`. Oh, forgot about `papirus` from the `AUR`.

After that, replace the `xfwm4` folder for both themes in `/usr/share/themes`.

user=whoami
Go to your `/home/$user/bin/` and place the `desktop-modes` and the `desktop-mode` inside.

If you have `rofi` then go ahead and download the `.Xresources` and replace it with yours ( or the part which starts with rofi ).
After that make sure to type in terminal `xrdb ~/.Xresources`.

Later on, run `chmod +x ~/bin/desktop-mode` in terminal...
`desktop-mode --help` and you should be ready to go.

To enable the theme you wish, just type `--day` or `--night` instead of the help argument.

Enjoy :)

> If you can clean up my `desktop-mode` script please do. I'm just an amateur.
